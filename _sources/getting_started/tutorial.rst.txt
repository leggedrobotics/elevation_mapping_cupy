Tutorial
******************************************************************
This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of the elevation mapping cupy. 
You will learn how to run the plane segmentation node, the sensor node, and the TurtleBot example. 

If you want to use your own custom plugins, please refer to the :ref:`plugins`.


Run
==================================================================

Basic usage.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch elevation_mapping_cupy elevation_mapping_cupy.launch


For the plane segmentation node

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch convex_plane_decomposition_ros convex_plane_decomposition.launch

For the sensor node

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch semantic_sensor semantic_pointcloud.launch
  roslaunch semantic_sensor semantic_image.launch


Run TurtleBot example
==================================================================

First, install turtlebot simulation.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt install ros-noetic-turtlebot3-gazebo ros-noetic-turtlebot3-teleop


Then, you can run the examples. For the basic version:

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch elevation_mapping_cupy turtlesim_simple_example.launch


For fusing semantics into the map such as rgb from a multi modal pointcloud:

.. image:: ../../media/turtlebot.png
    :alt: Elevation map examples

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch elevation_mapping_cupy turtlesim_semantic_pointcloud_example.launch

For fusing semantics into the map such as rgb semantics or features from an image:

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch elevation_mapping_cupy turtlesim_semantic_image_example.launch

Or, for the version including plane segmentation:

.. code-block:: bash

  catkin build convex_plane_decomposition_ros
  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch elevation_mapping_cupy turtlesim_plane_decomposition_example.launch


To control the robot with a keyboard, a new terminal window needs to be opened.
Then run

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch


Velocity inputs can be sent to the robot by pressing the keys `a`, `w`, `d`, `x`. To stop the robot completely, press `s`.




Errors
==================================================================

If you build with the install flag under ros melodic, you might get issues with the modules not found:

.. code-block:: bash

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pybind11::error_already_set'
    what():  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'elevation_mapping_cupy'

This is because python3 modules are installed into a different location.

This can be fixed by including also the python3 modules location in the `PYTHONPATH` by adding following line into the launch file:

.. code-block:: xml

  <env name="PYTHONPATH" value="<path_to_your_install>/lib/python3/dist-packages:$(env PYTHONPATH)" />

If you get error such as

.. code-block:: none

  Make Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.16/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:146 (message):
    Could NOT find PythonInterp: Found unsuitable version "2.7.18", but
    required is at least "3" (found /usr/bin/python)


Build with option.

.. code-block:: bash

  catkin build elevation_mapping_cupy -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3)
